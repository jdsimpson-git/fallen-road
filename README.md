# Fallen Road

> Your death becomes someone else's enemy.

A first-person, paper-diorama roguelike built as a Reddit interactive post for the Reddit Hackathon. Players swipe to slash, block and perfect-counter enemy attacks, break guards, and unleash weapon bursts. The full design lives in [Fallen_Road_Game_Design_Document.md](Fallen_Road_Game_Design_Document.md).

**Current status: Hackathon release candidate.** One run carries the player through four road fights, the Gatekeeper, and the Fallen King. Two three-way Gambit rewards, a final pre-throne choice, and two themed Paper Peddler stops shape a build from 15 Gambits and five weapons: **Paper Sword**, **Paper Spear**, **Paper Hammer**, **Paper Daggers**, and **Paper Mace**. Every weapon has its own attack rhythm and Burst. Health persists between fights (+18 on each kill); Gambits alter counter pressure, guard capacity, recovery, healing, Burst gain, and Burst damage.

Six adaptive road archetypes now fill the daily pool: **Road Soldier**, **Shield Bearer**, **Duelist**, **Spear Wraith**, **Bell Templar**, and **Cinder Reaver**. Leg hits slow, weapon-hand hits interrupt telegraphs, and the three final archetypes use dedicated painted paper-puppet rigs. Runtime art is kept near 2 MB while full-resolution generated sources remain under `assets/` for future reslicing.

Every ranked daily run receives the same UTC-seeded road order, Gambit deck, and enemy RNG. The Devvit server issues a short-lived, user-bound run ticket, recomputes scores, retains each traveller's best score in a Redis leaderboard, and shows the top three on Home. A daily defeat preserves a compact weapon/Gambit snapshot as a **Fallen Rival**; another traveller can choose an unranked revenge duel from Home without changing competitive daily scores.

## Stack

Built from the official [Devvit Phaser starter](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-phaser):

- [Devvit Web](https://developers.reddit.com/) — Reddit app platform (Redis permission enabled)
- [Phaser 4](https://phaser.io/) — game engine, fixed 1280x720 logical resolution, `Scale.FIT`
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) — server routes under `/api/*`
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) — request/response validation on server and client
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) — unit tests for all pure combat logic
- TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier
- Devvit MCP configured in [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) for agent documentation search

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run login    # authenticate the Devvit CLI with your Reddit account
npx devvit init  # bind this project to a new Devvit app (keeps existing code)
npm run dev      # playtest live on Reddit
```

To preview the client without Reddit: `npm run build`, then serve `dist/client`
(e.g. `python3 -m http.server 4173 --directory dist/client`) and open
`game.html`. The `/api` endpoints are unavailable in this mode and fail
gracefully.

## How the combat slice plays

- **Attack** — swipe (mouse drag or touch) through the soldier. Direction is
  classified into 8 ways; long, deliberate swipes become **heavy attacks**.
- **Weak point** — the head sways constantly; hitting it deals 1.5x damage and
  extra burst.
- **Block** — hold the shield button (touch), Space, or right mouse.
  Blocks reduce damage by 75% but drain your guard meter.
- **Perfect counter** — press the shield in the final 240 ms of the enemy's
  telegraph (watch for the golden flash on the blade). Negates the hit,
  staggers the soldier, damages his guard, and grants a large burst chunk.
- **Guard break** — both sides. An emptied guard meter means seconds of
  crumpled, defenseless paper.
- **Burst** — fill the meter, then press BURST (or Q). Sword flurries, spear
  thrusts, hammer guard-breaks, dagger storms, and mace impacts each behave
  and animate differently.
- The soldier telegraphs, blocks, side-steps, recovers, and can be
  guard-broken; fell him for victory, or die and rise again.

## Architecture

```text
src/
  shared/            # runs on client AND server, fully unit-tested
    balance/         # ALL tuning data: player, weapons, enemies, gestures,
                     # hit zones, burst gains — no numbers in logic code
    combat/          # pure logic: gesture classifier, segment-vs-zone hit
                     # detection, damage, guard meters, counter timing, burst,
                     # EnemyBrain (time-driven FSM with phases + counter stance),
                     # pattern tracking + capped adaptation, directional guard
    api.ts           # Zod schemas for /api contracts
    run/             # immutable run state, seeded daily generation, scoring
  client/
    game.ts          # Phaser config (1280x720 FIT)
    scenes/          # Boot -> Preloader -> Home (foe select) -> Battle
    combat/          # SwipeInput (pointer capture)
    entities/        # PaperEnemyView (data-driven cutout builder), PlayerRigView
    ui/              # Hud, backdrop, effects, theme
  server/
    index.ts         # Hono app
    routes/api.ts    # init, daily tickets/scores/leaderboard, Fallen Rival routes
```

Design rules enforced in code:

- **Balance lives in data files** (`src/shared/balance/`), never inline.
- **Pure combat logic is shared** so the server can later validate run
  submissions with the same math the client simulates.
- **Hit zones derive from live sprite positions** — a dodge really moves the
  hitbox; there is no hidden miss chance after a visually landed hit.
- The enemy brain is a plain TypeScript FSM with injected time and RNG.

## Testing

`npm test` — 118 tests covering gesture classification (distance / duration /
velocity thresholds, 8-direction classification, heavy detection, taps),
segment-vs-circle/rect hit detection and zone priority, damage and block
math, guard damage / break / regeneration timing, perfect-counter windows,
burst gain/activation, player-pattern tracking and capped weight adaptation,
directional guard resolution, and the full enemy brain lifecycle (attack
cycles, defensive cooldowns, counter stance / riposte / its cooldown,
interrupts, slows, phase transitions, burst lockdown).

## Roadmap (per the design document)

1. ~~Combat vertical slice~~
2. ~~Enemy variety: player-pattern adaptation, Shield Bearer, Duelist, phase framework~~
3. ~~Weapons (spear, hammer), Gambits, reward & merchant scenes; the Gatekeeper boss on the phase framework~~
4. ~~Full run structure, tutorial, travel, results & scoring~~
5. ~~Server-issued daily seed, leaderboards, run validation, **Fallen Rival system**~~ ← **you are here**
6. ~~Painted enemy/weapon art, mobile polish, submission verification~~
